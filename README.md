# Video Image Analysis for Object Detection and Tracking

This project is a web application that allows users to upload videos containing fish, which are then analyzed using a machine-learning model for object detection and tracking. The processed video can be downloaded with bounding boxes showing the detected objects. The application also provides statistics derived from the processed video.

The frontend of this application is built with React.js, while the backend uses Django. User authentication is included, with a login page for users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker

- Git

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   `git clone https://github.com/capstoneproject28/fish-detection-and-tracking.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   `cd fish-detection-and-tracking`

3. Build and run the Docker containers:

   `docker-compose up --build`

4. Once the command runs successfully, the application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Features
